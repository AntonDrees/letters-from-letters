# letters-from-letters
Nothing fancy - just an alphabet built from another in the most boring way

## What is in
Nothing real yet

## What is out
All the rest

## Notes
This repo acts like a mono repo - the blurred vision oracle hinted at hosting multiple language and package instances implementing the functionality in here. And of course, docker ... *packages*.
