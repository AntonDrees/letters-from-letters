# README - Javascript
Any implementation in Javascript resides within this folder or subfolders thereof.

## Dependencies
ECMAScript 2019 is required (for now) to boost exporation.

Developers are encouraged to use [Standard.js](https://github.com/standard/standard) for style and jest for the tests.
 We should add packaging documentation soon, as this might be a secondary implementation for the MVP.
